              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  Variables contain definitions of variables that can be used in composition of other expressions.
                  Each variable is defined as a named CEL expression.
                  The variables defined here will be available under `variables` in other expressions of the policy
                  except MatchConditions because MatchConditions are evaluated before the rest of the policy.

                  The expression of a variable can refer to other variables defined earlier in the list but not those after.
                  Thus, Variables must be sorted by the order of first appearance and acyclic.

                        Expression is the expression that will be evaluated as the value of the variable.
                        The CEL expression has access to the same identifiers as the CEL expressions in Validation.

                        Name is the name of the variable. The name must be a valid CEL identifier and unique among all variables.
                        The variable can be accessed in other expressions through `variables`
                        For example, if name is "foo", the variable will be available as `variables.foo`
