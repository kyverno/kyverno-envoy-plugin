# Policies

The Kyverno Authz Server supports two policy types:

- [ValidatingPolicy](./vpol/index.md) is the generic policy type introduced in recent kyverno versions and replaces the legacy `AuthorizationPolicy`
- [AuthorizationPolicy](./apol/index.md) is the legacy policy type and is **deprecated** (we plan to remove it in the next release)
